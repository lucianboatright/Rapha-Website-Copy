# A Copy of Rapha.cc Website using HTML only.

This was an exercise to improve my understanding and knowledge of HTML so rather than using and packages like Bootstrap or Tailwind I decided to only use HTML.
The project has given me a good understanding of how to make a reactive website that will scale as the page is shrunk. This has not been turned into a mobile ready yet to it will work on Desktops and iPads currently.
I was able to use a wide range of attributes from grids, borders and checkboxes to more specific attributes for selecting last-child tags or transitions for colour changes.
